Snipps allows you to capture and save interesting sections from any source of information. Be it textbooks, journals, computer screens, photographs, flyers, writings on a whiteboard, etc.

Take a picture of the section you're interested in and let Snipps turn it into an editable and searchable snippet that you can save for a book you're reading, a research paper you're working on, or a journal article you're writing.

 One place for all your references, quotes, study material, and inspirations.
